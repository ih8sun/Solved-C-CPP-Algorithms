# ABOUT **SOLVED-C/C++-Algorithms**

During my years at university, I successfully tackled various algorithms, developed video games for gaming consoles, and created reporting systems. Additionally, I devoted time to crafting exams, projects, and assignments for students in prominent universities in Peru and abroad. In this repository, I am sharing a glimpse of these accomplishments. If you are a student from universities such as UPC, UPN, UTP, UNMSM, UTEC, UC, UP or UNI, you may find some of the exams I've solved that could be beneficial to your studies.

# Why do some files have names of people?

Well, as I said before, most of the files are examens, or resolved tasks for students.
So what better than putting their names in the file?üòÆ‚Äçüí®

# What can I find here?

* Projects
* Examns
* Algorithm tasks
* Vectors
* Linked Lists
* Double Linked Lists
* Stack and Quee Data Structure
* Tree Data Structure
* Graphs Data Structure
* POO 
* Inheritance and polymorphism
* Reading Files with Fopen/Fstream
* and many others things done in C/C++

# Are all files resolved correctly?

Yep, aproximately 99%!!

# What compiler was the code made in?


Principally, I wrote most of the files in:

* Dev C/C++
* CLion / JetBrains
